**Description:**
By combining Duke Ph.D. committee membership data with the faculty appointments directory,
connections between academic organizations were found
and used to construct an undirected, weighted network (or graph).
From this network communities of closely linked organizations were created via the Louvain method.
Additionally, the level of interdisciplinary activity in each organization was measured
by comparing the relative weights of their external and self connections.
Analysis won 1st place in the competition.

**Methods:**
Network analysis,
Louvain method

**Software:**
`networkx`,
`pandas`
